Nodes

Edges
    Undirected - Two way edges <->
    Directed - One way edges ->

Representation
    Adjacency Matrix
    Adjacency list

DFS
    PreOrder
        First time when call comes to the node
    InOrder
        When the call wors inside the subtree of that node
    PostOrder
        After working on the subtree, call comes, back on the node. 
        After this, call won't come on the same node

    Weighted Nodes - Values are associated with nodes
    weighted Edges - Values are associated with Edges
