 civil resisters of precipitating a crisis. The Government aredeliberately inviting a crisis. They are precipitating violence by removing everyone who has any influence over the people and who can keep them non violent. Co operators do not see that the action of the Government is like that of a man who refuses to give food to a hungry man and then threatens to shoot him whilst he is attempting to help himself. In the midst of an enervating atmosphere such as ours, the duty before non co operators is clear. They must keep exemplary patience. They must not be goaded into precipitate action. They must refuse battle where they are not ready. It is no business of the Government to keep us non violent or to help us to remain so. Even their method of restraining violence is exasperatingly violent. In one respect, however, we must feel thankful to them, for their protest and criticism amount to nothing but this, that we I do not know how to practise our creed and that we are incompetent to inflict successful violence, even if we would. Let us admit both these arguments. We must be true to our creed. Then it is common cause that the Government must lay down arms. And let those who do not believe in the creed at least see that India is neither ready nor willing to meet violence with violence. I wish those who believe in the necessity of violence for Indias freedom will realize the truth of my position. They must not think that because they are ready and willing to do violence, India is likewise ready or willing. I claim that India is unready, not because she is helpless but because she is unwilling. Therefore, non violence is unexpectedly succeeding, whereas violence, in spite of the vaunted talk of human nature, would have failed. Indias past training for ages, I mean the training of the masses, has been against violence. Human nature in India has advanced so far that the doctrine of non violence is more natural for the people, at large than that of violence. Let us also remember that the experiences of Bombay and Madras prove my proposition. If the people of India were violent by nature, there was enough in Bombay and Madras to give rise to an unquenchable conflagration. A little violence, like dirt, is enough to disturb or soil a peaceful or clean surface, but either being a foreign addition is soon removed. To train India for violence and thus to wrest swaraj by violence is a work of ages. I verily believe that this wonderful manifestation of energy and national consciousness is purely and simply due to the advent of non violence. People have come to their own. Let no hasty action arrest its progress. Young India, 26 1 1922
