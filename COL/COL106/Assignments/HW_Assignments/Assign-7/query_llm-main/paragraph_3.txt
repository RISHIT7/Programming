 all the communities that make India a nation. If I knew the way to achieve it today, I know that I have the will and the strength to take it, however difficult or thorny it may be. I know too that the shortest and the surest way lies through non violence. Some Muslim friends tell me that Muslims will never subscribe to unadulterated non violence. With them, they say, violence is as lawful and necessary as non violence. The use of either depends upon circumstances. It does not need Koranic authority to justify the lawfulness of both. That is the well known path the world has traversed through the ages. There is no such thing as unadulterated violence in the world. But I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non violence. It regards forbearance as superior to vengeance. The very word Islam means peace, which is non violence. Badshah Kha 1 a staunch Muslim who never misses his namaz and Ramzan, has accepted out and out non violence as his creed. It would be no answer to say that he does not live up to his creed, even as I know to my shame that I do not. If there is difference in our actions, the difference is not one of kind, it is of degree. But argument about non violence in the holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis. I hold that for the full play of non violence only one party need believe in it. Indeed if both believe in it and live up to it, there is no appreciation or demonstration of it. To live at peace with one another is the most natural thing to do. But neither party gains the merit that the exercise of non violence carries with it. Unfortunately, at the present moment, those Hindus who do not know the use of violence, though they have it in their hearts, are sorry for their incapacity and would fain learn the trickI wont call it the artof violence, so as to be able to match what they describe as Muslim violence. And if peace is to be brought about by both parties being equally matched in the use of violence both offensive and defensive, I know that peace will not come in my lifetime and, if it came, I should not care to be witness of it. It will be an armed peace to be broken at any moment. Such has been the peace in Europe. Is not the present war enough to make one sick of such peace? Muslim friends who hope much from me will perhaps now recognize my agony for the unattainment of peace in spite of the travail that I have gone through and am still going through.
