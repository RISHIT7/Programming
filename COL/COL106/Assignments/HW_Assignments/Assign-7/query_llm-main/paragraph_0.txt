 devised a post graduate course. I have seen how he remained deeply engrossed in it. This had become the main objective of his life. I used to be his close associate. I had stayed in his house for several days. He had a group of some twenty chosen men. But a few such men, if they are firm in their conviction, can work like millions. This is how experts work. The Charkha Sangh, Gramodyog Sangh, [etc.,] cannot do such work. There, too, there are experts and they also do research. But your field would be much wider and much more specialized. Through them I am trying to serve Daridranarayana in particular. Their development will be only along those lines. Your work however would be quite unusual. You would not merely improve the tools and implements, but also see their conformity with our principles. I shall exercise my mind to help you as your co student; but I want to get the work mainly out of you. In this way research and discoveries are undertaken everywhere. Look at Germany. How many specialists are there in that country ! There they are in need of specialists in the science of violence. We too could do research and make progress in the field of non violence if we can have a small centre. We have to link the spinning wheel and related activities with non violence and ultimately with God. You will have to consider if all these things are possible. You know that even a society based on violence functions only with the help of experts. We want to bring about a new social order based on truth and non violence. We need experts to develop this into a science. The world as it functions today represents a mixture of violence and non violence. The external surface of the world suggests its internal state. A country like Germany which regards violence as God is engaged only in developing violence and glorifying it. We are watching the efforts that the votaries of violence are making. We must also know that those given to violence are watching our activities. They are observing what we are doing for developing our science. But the way of violence is old and established. It is not so difficult to do research in it. The way of non violence is new. The science of non violence is yet taking shape. We are still not conversant with all its aspects. There is a wide scope for research and experiment in this field. You can apply all your talents to it. For me non violence is something to be shunned if it is a private virtue. My concept of non violence is universal. It belongs to the millions. I am here just to serve them. Anything that cannot reach the
