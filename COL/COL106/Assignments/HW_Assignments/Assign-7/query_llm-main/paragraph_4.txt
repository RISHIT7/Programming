 defense? Mr.Zacharias is right in his description of the Khilafat. He is wrong in his estimate of the function of a votary of non violence. A beli ever in non violence is pledged not to resort to violence or physical force either directly or indirectly in defense of anything, but he is not precluded from helping men or institutions that are themselves not based on non violence. If the reverse were the case I would, for instance, be precluded from helping India to attain swaraj because the future Parliament of India under swaraj, I know for certain, will be having some military and police forces, or to take a domestic illustration, I may not help a son to secure justice, because forsooth he is not a believer in non violence. Mr. Zacharias's proposition will reduce all commerce by a believer in non violence to an impossibility. And there are not want ing men who do believe that complete non violence means complete cessation of all activity. Not such, however, is my doctrine of non violence. My business is to refrain from doing any violence myself, and to induce by persua sion and service as many of Gods creatures as I can to join me in the belief and practice. But I would be undrue to my faith if I refused to assist in a just cause any men or measures that did not entirely coin cide with the principle of non violence. I would be promoting vio lence, if finding the Mussulmans to be in the right, I did not assist them by means strictly non violent against those who had treache rously plotted the destruction of the dignity of Islam. Even when both parties believe in violence, there is often such a thing as justice on one side or the other. A robbed man has justice on his side, even though he may be 1 preparing to regain the lost property by force. And it would be accounted as a triumph of non violence if the injured party could be persuaded to regain his property by methods of satyagraha, i.e., love or soul force rather than a free fight. Of course it is open to Mr. Zacharias to reject my claim as a devotee of non violence, in view of all the limitations I have men tioned. I can only suggest to him that life is a very complex thing, and truth and non violence present problems which often defy analysis and judgment. One discovers truth and the method of applying the only legitimate means of vindicating it, i.e., satyagraha or soul force, by patient endeavour and silent prayer, I can only assure friends that I
