 tongues and something else in our hearts, what I have said will bear fruit. If you are not hypocrites you will go to the Assemblies with full faith in non violence and advance towards the goal. If you prove to be hypocrites it will not distress me. It would do us good if hypocrisy is exposed. When life leaves the body we burn it, even though it be that of a person as dear as a father, and we cast the ashes in the Ganga. If the soul of the Sangh, which is truth and non violence, leaves it, it will be the duty of Kishorelal to consign it to the flames. The Sangh will get vigour only if it is a living thing. If even today it has no life in it we are all hypocrites and it will be no use for the Sangh to continue to exist. Shastris tell me that truth and non violence are subtle things. They ask how one can form organizations out of abstract things. I assert that truth and non violence can be organized. If non violence cannot be organized, it is not a dharma. If there is anything special about me, it is only this, that I am organizing truth and non violence. Otherwise they will cease to be the eternal verities that they are to me. To me truth and non violence are not unreal things and if they cannot become our collective dharma they are false. What I want to do and want to die after doing, is to organize non violence. And if it is not valid in every field it is false. I assert that in every walk of life, non violence has its use. I speak the language of the Jains. They say that the rule should admit of no exception. This is also the language of geometry. A right angle must have 90 degrees. If there is any sphere of life in which non violence is ineffective it is false. Please remember this. If you all take the opposite path and give up the charkha and non violence, I will say that you never had faith in truth and non vilence. Believe it that though it may be without your knowing it, you were all votaries of violence., I do not condemn you. You have come to the Sangh after careful thought and in the name of truth.Remember that truth and non violence are not for hermits. These eternal principles apply in courts, legislatures and other spheres of human endeavour. Your faith is going to be put to a severe test. Do not run away in fright. You are being given today a difficult question paper. Neither you nor I know whether you will pass or not. Even so, why should I fear ? I do not want to render you impotent and stupid. Truth and non violence are not for the stupid. Why cannot Kanti, Bal, Tansukh 1
