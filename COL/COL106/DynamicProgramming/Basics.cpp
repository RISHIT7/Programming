/*
Optimal Substructure
    If we can erite a recurrence relation then the problem is said to
    have optimal substructure

Overlapping Subproblem
    If our subproblems repeat, then a problem is said to have 
    overlapping subproblem.



Ways to handle Overlapping Subproblems
    Memoization (top-down)
        A lookup table is maintained and checked before computation
        of any state. Recursion is involved.

    Tabulation (bottom-up)
        Solution is built from base. It is an iterative approach.


Key Points
    Minimisation and Maximisation problems are enerally solved with dp
    where we want exhaustive solution. (Sometimes with binary search on answer)

    "Find the number of ways" is also a very popular type of SP problems.

    Recurrence relation problems (Matrix exponentation also works)
